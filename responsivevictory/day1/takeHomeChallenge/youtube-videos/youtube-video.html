        <p>This quote from this video says it all "If you're a programmer who's feeling down. One of the best ways to boost your ego is to flex on other developers. For programmers there is only two states of being, imposter syndrome or superiority complex. ...the amount of money you make is exactly tied to the amount of value that you bring to the world."</p>
