<!-- To add a thrid party service for donations I would first do a browser search on how to add a donation option on an html web page with no javascript. The first thing that pops up is Givebutter. Its a free donation platform. Next is Zeffy. Both of these claim to be free to use they just require you to login. There are also template websites that you can purchase that come pre-built, like Webbytemplate. Which ever site I choose to handle the funtionality of donation will be attached to the button via an a tag, probably🤷‍♂️.-->
